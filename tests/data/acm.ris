AB  - Purpose of the review: Traditional autism screening and diagnosis has 
some limitations, they cannot meet the needs of large-scale screening 
and diagnosis. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technol
ogy to clinical medicine is a hot research topic recently, especially 
in mental health. China and international explorations of autism intel
ligent recognition technology have accumulated rich results in the fie
lds of brain imaging, expression, eye movement and action, multimode, 
and classical task behaviour. Meanwhile, a variety of intelligent ther
apeutic robots based on modal interaction are also developed. This pap
er reviews the shortcomings of the traditional diagnostic techniques f
or autism and the current research status of AI in the diagnosis and t
reatment, hope to provide a reference for relevant research on Autism 
applications based on AI.Research methods: Literature on the applicati
on of AI in autism screening diagnosis and intervention in recent year
s was searched through literature navigation, and we analyse the aspec
ts of autism screening, diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.Researc
h conclusion: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence te
chnology, it has become possible to use intelligent methods to carry o
ut early large-scale senseless screening and diagnosis of Autism. In t
he future, research should focus on building an intelligent medical sc
reening and diagnosis system for autism&nbsp;patient, developing scree
ning tools and constructing an intelligent identification model for pa
tients that integrates multimode data.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder charac
terized by impairments in social communication and interaction, as wel
l as restricted and repetitive behaviors. ASD affects individuals acro
ss various aspects of their lives, including their cognitive, social, 
and motor skills. Early detection and intervention are crucial for imp
roving outcomes and providing appropriate support to individuals with 
ASD. Handwriting is an essential skill that children develop early in 
life, and it provides valuable insights into their motor control, coor
dination, and cognitive processes. Good handwriting is crucial for aca
demic progress, social and communicative development, and development 
of self-esteem. By identifying the handwriting characteristics exhibit
ed by ASD children, we aim to develop a reliable and objective method 
for detecting ASD. We aim to identify the handwriting characteristics 
associated with ASD using deep learning techniques. The characteristic
s of Chinese characters, such as straight lines and turns, are conside
red in analyzing the writing characteristics of ASD children. We prese
nt a dataset of ASD children's handwriting in Traditional Chinese and 
fine-tunes three models to build a classification model. Experiment re
sults demonstrate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between 
the handwriting of ASD children and typically developing children, ach
ieving F1 score of 93.6%. The study provides valuable insights into ha
ndwriting characteristics in ASD and suggests directions for future re
search in this area.

AB  - This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environme
nt in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) e
ngage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) vir
tual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the inter
actions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was 
conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4–
14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of e
xposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in th
e analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the propor
tion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. 
The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtu
al agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the cours
e of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within
 the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence 
of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence 
of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article
 offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in t
he context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in 
real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodolog
ical challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisc
iplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interv
entions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers th
e design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and p
rocedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contribu
tions from different stakeholders, including children with and without
 ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), manifested in the forms of technologies,
 systems, tools, and applications, has advanced rapidly, especially in
 recent years. It has permeated many aspects of human behavior and nea
rly all sectors of society, such as healthcare and education. In the c
ontext of early childhood education (ECE), AI has afforded valuable op
portunities that directly and indirectly enhance children’s learning a
nd development. While there are already two existing reviews of the li
terature on AI in ECE, they show either a lack of descriptive informat
ion concerning selected studies or inconsistencies between inclusion/e
xclusion criteria and selected studies, thereby raising concerns about
 their rigor. Representing a more methodologically rigorous effort and
 a significant contribution to the field of AI in ECE, this scoping st
udy aimed to achieve three main goals: (1) “mapping” the global landsc
ape of the current extent, range, and nature of relevant studies on th
e affordances of AI for use in ECE, (2) identifying potential research
 gaps, and (3) charting future research directions. Specifically, it a
ddressed this overarching research question: What is the global landsc
ape of the current state of knowledge concerning the affordances of AI
 for use in ECE? Specifically, the state of knowledge here refers to t
hree aspects: (1) extent, (2) range, and (3) nature. First, regarding 
the extent aspect, the empirical knowledge was derived from 18 researc
h articles in 11 countries and 16 peer-reviewed academic journals betw
een 2005 and 2023, with 14 of these articles published in the past fou
r years (2020–2023). Second, with respect to the range of study popula
tions, it covered 15,081 children in early childhood (ages 2 to 8 year
s) across these 11 countries. Third, thematic analysis of these studie
s revealed four areas of AI affordances: (1) AI as tangible and intang
ible tools for interactive learning and information retrieval, (2) AI 
as technology for predicting/classifying children’s conditions, (3) AI
 as the object for learning by adapting to and personalizing children’
s learning, and (4) AI as the subject for children's learning about it
. Based on these findings, this scoping review identified three resear
ch gaps for future studies: (1) interviewing and/or surveying educatio
n stakeholders (parents, educators, policymakers) to explore the affor
dances of appropriate AI for use with, by, and for children bearing et
hical considerations; (2) conducting group comparisons to investigate 
contextual factors contributing to the “AI divide” among children from
 different socioeconomic backgrounds; and (3) comparing sociocultural 
influences on AI use in ECE across cultures.

AB  - In pediatric healthcare in the Philippines, practical communication to
ols are essential for children facing challenges in conventional expre
ssion. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a transform
ative solution that enables non-verbal pediatric patients to articulat
e their thoughts and emotions effectively. The study explores 49 paper
s from a pool of 182, uncovering critical challenges and innovative so
lutions on a global scale. The transformative impact of Text-to-Speech
 (TTS) technology is highlighted, as well as the essential role of tra
nsition services in preparing individuals for employment. The study al
so examines the power of self-advocacy training, communication boards,
 and mobile AAC software in empowering students and fostering socializ
ation. A hierarchical conceptual framework is proposed to guide the de
velopment of the Filipino-based AAC mobile application that integrates
 contextual and mediating variables. The implications of this research
 are broad, affecting education, healthcare, and technology sectors. I
t emphasizes the importance of continuous training and support for edu
cators, caregivers, and individuals with disabilities. Overall, this r
esearch significantly advances our understanding of AAC and lays the g
roundwork for practical interventions that promote inclusivity for ind
ividuals with communication challenges.

AB  - As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) develops rapidly, equipp
ing students with basic knowledge of GenAI at the secondary school lev
el is beneficial. However, few subjects in special schools cover AI-re
lated topics, and it remains unclear how students with special educati
onal needs (SEN) perceive, learn, and use AI. In this study, we docume
nted the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) learning exp
erience of seven students from two special schools who participated in
 a series of game design workshops. We analysed their learning process
, usage, and perspectives of text-to-image GenAI through video analysi
s, questionnaire, and evaluation of design outputs. Our findings revea
l the students' willingness to learn and utilise AI technology. This A
I experience allows students, especially those who struggle with fine 
motor skills, to translate their ideas into digital images. Moreover, 
the text-to-image interaction enhances students' ability to convey the
ir ideas in writing and develop their skills in conceptualisation. We 
also summarised significant human-AI interaction challenges, including
 difficulties with typing, Chinese and English spelling, and prompt wr
iting. We conclude with recommendations for designing future inclusive
 human-AI interaction experiences for students with SEN in China.

AB  - It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Eleventh An
nual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2024, held July 18-20, 2
024 at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.The Learning at Scale con
ference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), 
inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and t
he accompanying shift in thinking about education. During the last few
 years, new opportunities for scaling up learning have emerged, like h
ybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, and inf
ormal learning enabled by all sorts of platforms (e.g., gamified langu
age learning, citizen science communities, and collaborative programmi
ng communities). In the recent two years, the unprecedented developmen
t of generative AI has brought profound opportunities to scale the tea
ching and learning experiences, with the goal of enhancing learning fo
r the increasingly diverse group of learners in both formal and inform
al contexts. L@S has evolved along with these emergent massive learnin
g scenarios and opportunities and is today one of the most prominent v
enues for discussion of the highest quality of research on how learnin
g and teaching can be transformed at scale, in diverse learning enviro
nments.The theme of L@S 2024 is Scaling Learning in the Age of AI. Rap
id advances in AI have created new opportunities but also challenges f
or the Learning@Scale community. The advances in generative AI show po
tential to enhance pedagogical practices and the efficacy of learning 
at scale. This has led to an unprecedented level of interest in employ
ing generative AI for scaling tutoring and feedback. The prevalence of
 such tools calls for new practices and understanding on how AI-based 
methods should be designed and developed to enhance the experiences an
d outcomes of teachers and learners.Learning@Scale 2024 solicits empir
ical and theoretical papers on, but not limited to, the following topi
cs (in no particular order): 1) Instruction at scale: studies that exa
mine how teachers and educators scale their instructions, what aspects
 of instruction could be scaled effectively, and which of these instru
ctional strategies are the most effective for learning. 2) Interventio
ns at scale: studies that examine the effects of interventions on stud
ent learning and performance when implemented at scale. We welcome stu
dies that use both qualitative and quantitative methods. 3) The use of
 generative AI to scale learning: studies that investigate stakeholder
s' experiences with generative AI, students' and teachers' interaction
s with generative AI, and the potentials and limitations of using gene
rative AI in education. 4) Systems and tools to support learning at sc
ale: research that designs and develops systems and tools to support l
earning at scale. For example, this involves scaling learning through 
web-based systems, MOOCs, visualization, intelligent tutoring systems,
 gamification, immersive techniques (AR/VR/MR), mobile technologies, t
angible interfaces, and various other technologies. 5) The evaluation 
of existing learning at scale systems and online learning environments
 using but not limited to the above-mentioned technologies. 6) Methods
 and algorithms that model learner behavior: research that contributes
 methods, algorithms, and pipelines that process large student data to
 enhance learning at scale. 7) Scaling learning in informal contexts: 
studies that explore how people take advantage of online environments 
to pursue their interests informally. 8) Review and synthesis of exist
ing literature related to learning at scale. 9) Empirical studies and 
interventions that address equity, trust, algorithmic transparency and
 explainability, fairness and bias when using AI in education. 10) Res
earch that addresses accessibility in learning at scale contexts. 11) 
Design and deployment of learning at scale systems for learners from u
nderrepresented groups.

e provision of parenting support? To explore the role of AI technologi
es in supporting parenting behaviour—and child-well-being—we surveyed 
92 parents to gather their perspectives on nine future-oriented scenar

ds and preferences around the design of agent-based supports. We explo
re the perceived benefits of AI assistants (i.e., receiving objective 
feedback, managing emotions and personalised guidance) and the most vo
iced concerns (i.e., AI undermining parental authority, replacing huma
n interactions, and promoting lazy parenting). Finally, we highlight a
 number of plausible design directions based on the scenarios that par
ents were positive about.

AB  - The occurrence of unknown words in texts significantly hinders reading
 comprehension. To improve accessibility for specific target populatio
ns, computational modeling has been applied to identify complex words 
in texts and substitute them for simpler alternatives. In this article
, we present an overview of computational approaches to lexical comple
xity prediction focusing on the work carried out on English data. We s
urvey relevant approaches to this problem which include traditional ma
chine learning classifiers (e.g., SVMs, logistic regression) and deep 
neural networks as well as a variety of features, such as those inspir
ed by literature in psycholinguistics as well as word frequency, word 
length, and many others. Furthermore, we introduce readers to past com
petitions and available datasets created on this topic. Finally, we in
clude brief sections on applications of lexical complexity prediction,
 such as readability and text simplification, together with related st
udies on languages other than English.

AB  - Driving is essential for many people in developed countries to achieve
 independence. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), in add
ition to having social skill deficits, may experience difficulty in le
arning to drive due to deficits in attention-shifting, performing sequ
ential tasks, integrating visual-motor responses, and coordinating mot
or response. Lacking confidence and feeling anxiety further exacerbate
s these concerns. While there is a growing body of research regarding 
assessment of driving behavior or comparisons of driving behaviors bet
ween individuals with and without ASD, there is a lack of driving simu
lator that is catered toward the needs of individuals with ASD. We pre
sent the development of a novel closed-loop adaptive Virtual Reality (
VR) driving simulator for individuals with ASD that can infer one's en
gagement based on his/her physiological responses and adapts driving t
ask difficulty based on engagement level in real-time. We believe that
 this simulator will provide opportunities for learning driving skills
 in a safe and individualized environment to individuals with ASD and 
help them with independent living. We also conducted a small user stud
y with teenagers with ASD to demonstrate the feasibility and tolerabil
ity of such a driving simulator. Preliminary results showed that the p
articipants found the engagement-sensitive system more engaging and mo
re enjoyable than a purely performance-sensitive system. These finding
s could support future work into driving simulator technologies, which
 could provide opportunities to practice driving skills in cost-effect
ive, supportive, and safe environments.

AB  - Social robots, particularly in assisting children with autism, have ex
hibited positive impacts on mental health. While prior studies concent
rated on social robots in the Global North, there’s limited exploratio
n in the Global South. It’s essential to comprehend special educators’
 perspectives for effective integration in resource-constrained settin
gs. Our mixed-methods approach, involving interviews, workshops, and a
 panel discussion with 25 educators in India, uncovers challenges and 
opportunities in integrating social robots into autism interventions. 
The findings highlight the urgent need to democratise the benefits of 
social robotics. Special educators express concerns about their functi
onal capacity and fear potential redundancy due to the replacement of 
human efforts by social robots. Despite initial scepticism, profession
als suggest various ways to incorporate social robots, emphasising the
 importance of technological innovation in reshaping and enhancing the
ir roles in autism therapy. We discuss the implications of these findi
ngs for developing context-aware solutions and policy-level initiative
s necessary in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - People with cognitive and learning disabilities make up a significant 
percentage of the general population. Among the difficulties of this g
roup, it is frequent that they present a poor comprehension of texts. 
The easy-to-read guidelines facilitate the comprehension of texts but 
adapting texts according to these rules is a time-consuming manual lab
our. There are automatic approaches to simplify texts and assess diffi
culty after the text is published, but there is not a tool to help wri

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects many people; the Center for Dis
ease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 59 children are curren
tly identified with ASD in the United States. Although it is difficult
 to generalize about people with ASD due to their heterogeneity, many 
share an affinity for technologies; as such, numerous academic endeavo
rs and commercial products have focused on the creation of interactive
 technologies for ASD. In this article, we present findings from 19 in
terviews and 230 surveys with parents, teachers, and therapists who ha
d children with ASD in their care and had considered or used interacti
ve technologies with those children. We aimed to understand how intera
ctive technologies were used, perceived, desired, and discovered. Find
ings of use and perception included the following: participants had tr
ied a wide range of commercially available technologies but had very f
ew reported products in common, products were limited to commercial mo
bile-based apps, and apps were typically perceived positively. In rega
rd to desires, participants hoped for future technologies on diverse p
latforms (e.g., robots, virtual reality) with more consideration given
 to personalization, customization, and incorporation of audio and vid
eo. Findings about discovery included the following: participants chos
e technologies in an information-poor environment, and although there 
are many academic projects aimed at participants’ desires, no particip
ants reported any experience working with researchers. Implications of
 this study include the need for a recommendation and information shar
ing system to help people choose and discover appropriate and effectiv
e interactive technologies that are a good fit for their child. This w
ork also pointed to a need for such a system to include findings from 
lab (experimental and usability) studies of commercially available int
eractive technologies to provide measures of efficacy and usability. O
ur envisioned system could also potentially help academic researchers 
with outreach to wider audiences.

AB  - Communication disabilities can limit individuals’ social interaction, 
often leading to isolation and reduced quality of life. Speech-languag
e pathologists (SLPs) can address these challenges through tailored in
terventions, often supported by assistive technologies. This study exp
lores how conversational agents (CAs) can support individuals with com
munication disabilities by incorporating SLP expertise through a co-de
sign approach. We conducted a two-phase study: a co-design workshop to
 understand the needs of the target population and potential roles of 
CAs to support communication skill training, and a subsequent evaluati
on session with a CA prototype by a group of SLPs. Our findings highli
ghted the importance of designing accessibility, personalization, and 
motivation features of CAs with greater depth, augmentation, and preci
sion, emphasizing the need for multiple interaction modalities, real-t
ime and deeply tailored personalization, and more intrinsic motivation
al strategies. Our work contributes to the design and application of i
nclusive CAs in communication therapy, with implications for clinical 
and home settings.

AB  - Impairment in pragmatic language is one of the most noticeable symptom
s of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Abnormal activity in the inferio
r frontal gyrus (IFG), a critical language area associated with pragma
tic meaning processing, has been repeatedly reported in individuals wi
th ASD. While brain areas are connected via&nbsp;networks, few studies
 have examined how the intrinsic network of IFG is connected atypicall
y to other brain areas in ASD participants&nbsp;compared to typical co
ntrols. To elucidate the putative brain network underlying IFG, we com
pared the resting-state functional connectivity in ASD and typically d
eveloping children. A two-sample t-test based on 16 autistic and 16 ty
pically developing children revealed that both LIFG and RIFG had aberr
ant functional connectivity. Specifically, compared to the typically d
eveloping children, the ASD group had lower pragmatic language perform
ance and were associated with weaker connectivity between LIFG and inf
erior occipital gyrus (IOG), inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part (I
FGoperc), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and thalamus (THA), but increase
d functional connectivity between LIFG and cingulate gyrus (CG). Regar
ding RIFG, our study revealed reduced functional connectivity between 
RIFG and the fusiform (FFG), lingual gyrus (LING), pons, and cuneus (C
UN), but increased functional connectivity between RIFG and the middle
 temporal gyrus (MTG). This altered brain network is closely linked to
 the classical network of Theory of mind (ToM) network, which provides
 a rationale for understanding pragmatic language impairment in autism
. Based on the results of functional connectivity, this study discusse
d the possible reasons of pragmatic impairment in children with autism
 in the scope of ToM, and provided suggestions for the neural mechanis
m, clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation of children with autism who h
ave pragmatic disorders.

AB  - Reading skills are crucial for students' success in education and beyo
nd. However, reading proficiency among K-12 students has been declinin
g globally, including in Sweden, leaving many underprepared for post-s
econdary education. Additionally, an increasing number of students hav
e reading disorders, such as dyslexia, which require support. Generati
ve artificial intelligence (genAI) technologies, like ChatGPT, may off
er new opportunities to improve reading practices by enhancing the rea
dability of educational texts. This study investigates whether ChatGPT
-4 can simplify academic texts and which prompting strategies are most
 effective. We tasked ChatGPT to re-write 136 academic texts using fou
r prompting approaches: Standard, Meta, Roleplay, and Chain-of-Thought
. All four approaches improved text readability, with Meta performing 
the best overall and the Standard prompt sometimes creating texts that
 were less readable than the original. This study found variability in
 the simplified texts, suggesting that different strategies should be 
used based on the specific needs of individual learners. Overall, the 
findings highlight the potential of genAI tools, like ChatGPT, to impr
ove the accessibility of academic texts, offering valuable support for
 students with reading difficulties and promoting more equitable learn

AB  - Generative AI (AI) has become ubiquitous in both daily and professiona
l life, with emerging research demonstrating its potential as a tool f
or accessibility. Neurodivergent people, often left out by existing ac
cessibility technologies, develop their own ways of navigating normati
ve expectations. GAI offers new opportunities for access, but it is im
portant to understand how neurodivergent “power users”—successful earl
y adopters—engage with it and the challenges they face. Further, we mu
st understand how marginalization and intersectional identities influe
nce their interactions with GAI. Our autoethnography, enhanced by priv
acy-preserving GAI-based diaries and interviews, reveals the intricaci
es of using GAI to navigate normative environments and expectations. O
ur findings demonstrate how GAI can both support and complicate tasks 
like code-switching, emotional regulation, and accessing information. 
We show that GAI can help neurodivergent users to reclaim their agency
 in systems that diminish their autonomy and self-determination. Howev
er, challenges such as balancing authentic self-expression with societ
al conformity, alongside other risks, create barriers to realizing GAI
’s full potential for accessibility.

AB  - In the last decade, deep learning and word embeddings have made signif
icant impacts on information retrieval (IR) by adding techniques based
 in neural networks and language models. At the same time, certain sea
rch modalities such as neural IR and conversational search have become
 more popular. This book, written by international academic and indust
ry experts, brings the field up to date with detailed discussions of t
hese new approaches and techniques. The book is organized in three sec
tions: Foundations, Adaptations and Concerns, and Verticals.Under Foun
dations, we address topics that form the basic structure of any modern
 IR system, including recommender systems. These new techniques are de
veloped to augment indexing, retrieval, and ranking. Neural IR, recomm
ender systems, evaluation, query-driven functionality, and knowledge g
raphs are covered in this section.IR systems need to adapt to specific
 user characteristics and preferences, and techniques that were consid
ered too niche a few years ago are now a matter of system design consi
deration. The Adaptations and Concerns section covers the following to
pics: conversational search, cross-language retrieval, temporal extrac
tion and retrieval, bias in retrieval systems, and privacy in search.W
hile web search engines are the most popular information access point,
 there are cases where specific verticals provide a better experience 
in terms of content and relevance. The Verticals section describes eCo
mmerce, professional search, personal collections, music retrieval, an
d biomedicine as examples.

AB  - One of the key challenges faced by autistic children is understanding 
social affordances in complex environments, which further impacts thei
r ability to respond appropriately to social signals. In traffic scena
rios, this impairment can even lead to safety concerns. In this paper,
 we introduce an LLM-simulated immersive projection environment design
ed to improve this ability in autistic children while ensuring their s
afety. We first propose 17 design considerations across four major cat
egories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous research. Nex
t, we developed a system called AIRoad, which leverages LLMs to simula
te drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit mul
timodal social signals. AIRoad helps autistic children bridge the gap 
in recognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriat
e responses through various stimuli. A user study involving 14 partici
pants demonstrated that this technology effectively engages autistic c
hildren and leads to significant improvements in their comprehension o
f social affordances in traffic scenarios. Additionally, parents repor
ted high perceived usability of the system. These findings highlight t
he potential of combining LLM technology with immersive environments f
or the functional rehabilitation of autistic children in the future.

AB  - Text simplification (TS) reduces the complexity of the text to improve
 its readability and understandability, while possibly retaining its o
riginal information content. Over time, TS has become an essential too
l in helping those with low literacy levels, non-native learners, and 
those struggling with various types of reading comprehension problems.
 In addition, it is used in a preprocessing stage to enhance other NLP
 tasks. This survey presents an extensive study of current research st
udies in the field of TS, as well as covering resources, corpora, and 
evaluation methods that have been used in those studies.

AB  - Hearing parents of deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children often strug
gle to provide meaningful sign inputs while learning a new language th
emselves. This work aims to understand the needs and challenges of hea
ring parents to use American Sign Language (ASL) when interacting with
 their DHH children, as well as preferences regarding AI-mediated comm
unication technologies that support face-to-face interaction in ASL wi
th DHH children. We adopted the technology probe design method to inve
stigate key design elements that contribute to the usefulness of ASL r
ecommendations and user autonomy in AI-mediated technologies. Findings
 of a semi-structured interview study show that ASL recommendations ar
e considered useful when they align with users’ needs, and offer diver
sity and serendipity. In addition, participants desire more control ov
er automatic recommendations, but more autonomy does not always guaran
tee greater user satisfaction. We conclude with design insights for fu
ture AI-mediated communication technologies for parent-child interacti
ons.

AB  - This study examined how different reading modes-human reader, reading 
robot, and reading pen-impact young children's engagement and comprehe
nsion. By analyzing physiological measures such as Electrodermal Activ
ity (EDA) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) alongside comprehension per
formance, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of each mode and explor
e the potential of robots as educational tools. Positioned between the
 interactive human reader and the passive reading pen, the reading rob
ot not only sustained engagement for the longest duration but also ach
ieved the highest comprehension scores. The robot effectively balanced
 emotional arousal and stress levels, facilitating enhanced cognitive 
processing and information retention. Additionally, a positive correla
tion was found between family technology use and both engagement and c
omprehension with the robot. These findings suggest that interactive t
echnology can enhance early childhood learning by bridging the gap bet
ween human interaction and traditional learning tools.

AB  - Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVE) have shown potential to be an
 effective social skill training platform for children with Autism Spe
ctrum Disorders (ASD) to learn and practice collaborative and communic
ation skills through peer interactions. However, most existing CVE sys
tems require that appropriately matched partners be available at the s
ame time to promote interaction, which limits their applicability to s
ome community settings due to scheduling constraints. A second shortco
ming of these more naturalistic peer-based designs is the intensive re
sources required to manually code the unrestricted conversations that 
occurred during the peer-based interactions. To preserve the benefits 
of CVE-based platforms and mitigate some of the resource limitations r
elated to peer availability, we developed an Intelligent Collaborative
 Haptic-Gripper System (INC-Hg). This system provides an intelligent a
gent partner who can understand, communicate, and haptically interact 
with the user, without requiring the presence of another human peer. T
he INC-Hg operates in real time and thus is able to perform collaborat
ive training tasks at any time and at the user's pace. INC-Hg can also
 record the real-time data regarding spoken language and task performa
nce, thereby greatly reducing the resource burden of communication and
 interaction performance analysis. A preliminary usability study with 
10 participants with ASD (ages 8–12 years) indicated that the system c
ould classify the participant's utterances into five classes with an a
ccuracy of 70.34%, which suggested the potential of INC-Hg to automati
cally recognize and analyze conversational content. The results also i
ndicated high accuracies of the agent to initiate a conversation (97.5
6%) and respond to the participants (86.52%), suggesting the capabilit
y of the agent to conduct proper conversations with the participants. 
Compared to the results of human-to-human collaborative tasks, the hum
an-to-agent mode achieved higher average collaborative operation ratio
 (61% compared to 40%) and comparable average frequencies for Initiati
ons and Responses among the participants with ASD. These results offer
 preliminary support as well as areas of improvement regarding the age
nt's ability to respond to participants, work with participants to com
plete tasks, engage in back-and-forth conversations, and support the p
otential of the agent to be a useful partner for individuals with ASD 
completing CVE tasks.

AB  - End-users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) have div
erse speech, cognitive, and motor abilities. AAC’s heterogeneous user 
groups and persistent usability issues create a challenging and rich d
esign space. Our work takes a value-sensitive design (VSD) approach to
 develop a stakeholder value framework that describes stakeholders’ mu
lti-dimensional roles and values. Our framework is based on (1) an emp
irical investigation—a survey and interviews—of AAC users and AAC conv
ersation partners and (2) a conceptual investigation—a systematic lite
rature review—of AAC HCI research. Emergent value themes were ease, fu
lfillment, acceptance, adaptation, safety, performance, autonomy, just
ice, design fulfillment, and business fulfillment. These themes inform
 how AAC end-users engage with AAC and how indirect stakeholders, such
 as AAC technologists, make choices that ultimately impact AAC users. 
Our stakeholder value framework and rich descriptions of AAC socio-tec
hnical barriers can inform AAC designers in making ethically sound dec
isions that support, not hinder, stakeholder values.

AB  - The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive o
verview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Inte
lligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agen
ts (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous ag
ents that are able to perceive an environment including people or othe
r agents, reason, and decide how to interact, and express attitudes su
ch as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interactin
g with people and each other in a socially intelligent manner using mu
ltimodal communicative behaviors with the goal to support humans in va
rious domains.Written by international experts in their respective fie
lds, the book summarizes research in the many important research commu
nities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and fut
ure directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and stud
ying SIAs for researchers and students and aims at further bridging th
e gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the bo
ok clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume star
ts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular res
earch methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It fu
rther examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multim
odality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated by differe
nt theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-soci
ality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, exam
ined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group 
interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive o
verview summarizing research and systems of human-agent platforms and 
of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, agin
g support, autism or games.

AB  - Social robots' contributions to education are notorious but, in times,
 limited by the difficulty in their programming by regular teachers. O
ur framework named R-CASTLE aims to overcome this problem by providing
 the teachers with an easy way to program their content and the robot'
s behavior through a graphical interface. However, the robot's behavio
r adaptation algorithm maybe still not the best intuitive method for t
eachers' understanding. Fuzzy systems have the advantage of being mode
led in a more human-like way than other methods due to their implement
ation based on linguistic variables and terms. Thus, fuzzy modeling fo
r robot behavior adaptation in educational children-robot interactions
 is proposed for this framework. The modeling resulted in an adaptatio
n algorithm that considers a multimodal and autonomous assessment of t
he students' skills: attention, communication, and learning. Furthermo
re, preliminary experiments were performed considering videos with the
 robot in a school environment. The adaptation was set to change the c
ontent approach difficulty to produce a suitably challenging behavior 
according to each students' reactions. Results were compared to a Rule
-Based adaptive method. The fuzzy modeling showed similar accuracy to 
the ruled-based method with a suggestion of a more intuitive interpret
ation of the process.

AB  - Traditional symbol-based AAC devices impose meta-linguistic and memory
 demands on individuals with complex communication needs and hinder co
nversation partners from stimulating symbolic language in meaningful m
oments. This work presents a prototype application that generates situ
ation-specific communication boards formed by a combination of descrip
tive, narrative, and semantic related words and phrases inferred autom
atically from photographs. Through semi-structured interviews with AAC
 professionals, we investigate how this prototype was used to support 
communication and language learning in naturalistic school and therapy
 settings. We find that the immediacy of vocabulary reduces conversati
on partners’ workload, opens up opportunities for AAC stimulation, and
 facilitates symbolic understanding and sentence construction. We cont
ribute a nuanced understanding of how vocabularies generated automatic
ally from photographs can support individuals with complex communicati
on needs in using and learning symbolic AAC, offering insights into th
e design of automatic vocabulary generation methods and interfaces to 
better support various scenarios of use and goals.

 in the prevention and learning sciences. Preliminary results point to
 a set of socio-technical design approaches shaping player behavior wh
ile also supporting youth interest in Minecraft-like online environmen
ts. More broadly, the findings suggest an alternative vision of youth’
s capacity for ownership and control of mechanisms shaping the culture
 and climate of their online communities: managing player behavior whi
le challenging current norms around adult control and surveillance of 
youth activity.

AB  - We are delighted to welcome you to Melbourne, Australia for ACM Multim
edia 2024, the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Mu
ltimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of
 multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Mult
imedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practition
ers from academia and industry to present their innovative research an
d to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time sinc
e the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to 
the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event.
 With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are ex
cited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, 
where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and 
support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 r
eceived over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,
100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In a
ddition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 wor
kshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've p
repared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and
 tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main confere
nce occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be acces
sible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure pro
ceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conf
erence period.This year's conference features three distinguished acad
emic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel 
discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea 
(BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote 
will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, 
ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in t
he Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University 
of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous com
puting, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to 
harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote 
will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester,
 a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of A
cademia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will dis
cuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, 
we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review 
process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program co
mmittee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review
 announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to a
lign with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionall
y, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia 
for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks,
 and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for 
further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclus
ive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we
 have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multi
media 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM tra
vel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunte
ers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have 
arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young chil
dren. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the confer
ence, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cul
tural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and t
hought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange
 ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe
. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of 
Melbourne and its surrounding regions.

AB  - The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first a
uthoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new
 computer interfaces: user input involving new media (speech, multi-to
uch, hand and body gestures, facial expressions, writing) embedded in 
multimodal-multisensor interfaces that often include biosignals.This e
dited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in t
he field. It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap fo
r professionals working in this and related areas.This second volume o
f the handbook begins with multimodal signal processing, architectures
, and machine learning. It includes recent deep-learning approaches fo
r processing multisensorial and multimodal user data and interaction, 
as well as context-sensitivity. A further highlight is processing of i
nformation about users' states and traits, an exciting emerging capabi
lity in next-generation user interfaces. These chapters discuss real-t
ime multimodal analysis of emotion and social signals from various mod
alities and perception of affective expression by users. Further chapt
ers discuss multimodal processing of cognitive state using behavioral 
and physiological signals to detect cognitive load, domain expertise, 
deception, and depression. This collection of chapters provides walk-t
hrough examples of system design and processing, information on tools 
and practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and
 terminology, and tutorial support for mastering this rapidly expandin
g field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views o
n the timely and controversial challenge topic of multimodal deep lear
ning. The discussion focuses on how multimodal-multisensor interfaces 
are most likely to advance human performance during the next decade.

AB  - Welcome to UbiComp/ISWC 2024, the companion program of two premier con
ferences: The 2024 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and
 Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp 2024) and the 2024 International Sympos
ium on Wearable Computers (ISWC 2024). UbiComp and ISWC are premier in
terdisciplinary venues for international researchers, designers, devel
opers, practitioners and educators in the field to present and discuss
 novel and impactful research in interactive, mobile, wearable and ubi
quitous computing. The companion program has traditionally been a very
 important part of the UbiComp/ISWC conference series.UbiComp/ISWC 202
4 is held from October 5 to 9, 2024 in Melbourne, Australia. Originall
y, UbiComp/ISWC was scheduled to take place in Melbourne in 2021. Howe
ver, due to the significant impact of COVID-19, our community decided 
to postpone conferences taking place in their traditional form until l
ast year, when UbiComp took place as an in-person event in Mexico. Now
, in 2024 we look to consolidate the strength and ties in our communit
y by having another fully in-person event and hoping to welcome a new 
generation of researchers to meet and explore the wonderful people tha
t make up our community.

AB  - The goal of the study is to reveal the correlation between speech pecu
liarities and different aspects of development of children with autism
 spectrum disorders. The participants in the study were 28 children wi
th autism spectrum disorders (ASD) aged 4-11 years and 64 adults - lis
tening to children's speech samples. Children with ASD were divided in
to two groups: ASD-1 - ASD is the leading symptom (F84, n=17); childre
n assigned to ASD-2 (n=11) had other disorders accompanied by ASD symp
tomatology (F83 + F84). Recording of children's speech and behavior wa
s carried out in the most similar situations: a dialogue with the expe
rimenter, viewing pictures and retelling a story about them or answers
 to questions, book reading. The child's psychophysiological character
istics were estimated according to the method which includes determini
ng the leading hemisphere by speech (dichotic listening test - DLT), p
honemic hearing, and the profile of lateral functional asymmetry (PLFA
). All tasks and the time of the study were adapted to the child's cap
acities. The study analyzed the level of speech formation in 4-11 year
-old children with ASD, identified direct and indirect relationships b
etween the features of early development, its psychophysiological indi
cators, and the speech development level at the time of the study. The
 ability of adults to recognize the psychoneurological state of childr
en via their speech is determined. The results of the study support th
e need to increase focus on and understanding of the language strength
s and weaknesses in children with ASD and an individual approach to te
aching children.

AB  - Current mechanisms for adopting and supporting high-tech augmentative 
and alternative communication (AAC) within special-education appear li
mited in their success, despite recognition of the potential benefits 
they represent for young emerging communicators. Prior research in thi
s field has been restricted to discrete survey or interview methodolog
ies. We present a five-month mixed-methods ethnographic study in a spe
cial-education school to explore the facilitators and barriers experie
nced by those using technology, with children who have little or no fu
nctional speech, to stimulate communication and language comprehension
. Our analysis supports the outcomes of earlier studies, but also furn
ishes novel insights into the scale and urgency of addressing the prob
lem—with implications for user-centred design within this community. W
e highlight infrastructure, policy, and recruitment deficits, and prop
ose a two-fold solution: (i) an increase in engagement with this popul
ation through the provision of enhanced, user-centred support; and (ii
) induction of the cross-disciplinary role of Assistive Technologist, 
to serve as mediator between teacher, aided communicator, and their as
sistive technology. This work represents a contribution towards establ
ishing more effective operational, interactional, and pedagogical supp
ort for learners using high-tech communication devices.

AB  - Welcome one and all to the 19th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conferen
ce on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)!We are so pleased to re-welcome th
e HRI community to Boulder, Colorado, where HRI 2021 would have been h
eld, had the COVID pandemic not interfered. Following up on the succes
sful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme 
is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring 
human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspe
ct of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a rob
ot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the
 world will showcase their research and development via actual, intera
ctive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our 
hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years int
o a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an imp
ressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from
 around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the 
previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic s
ubcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal p
hase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From thi
s process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presenta
tion at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and
 ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Librar
y and IEEE Xplore.

AB  - Sentence Simplification (SS) aims to modify a sentence in order to mak
e it easier to read and understand. In order to do so, several rewriti
ng transformations can be performed such as replacement, reordering, a
nd splitting. Executing these transformations while keeping sentences 
grammatical, preserving their main idea, and generating simpler output
, is a challenging and still far from solved problem. In this article,
 we survey research on SS, focusing on approaches that attempt to lear
n how to simplify using corpora of aligned original-simplified sentenc
e pairs in English, which is the dominant paradigm nowadays. We also i
nclude a benchmark of different approaches on common data sets so as t
o compare them and highlight their strengths and limitations. We expec
t that this survey will serve as a starting point for researchers inte
rested in the task and help spark new ideas for future developments.

AB  - Objective: Through computerised analysis of writing ability assessment
 data, the aim was to compare the effectiveness of two generations of 
hardware smart writing devices in the application of children's writin
g performance ability from 6 to 12 years of age, and to provide data s
upport for accurate screening and assessment of those with writing dif
ficulties. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess th
e writing performance ability of primary school students in grades 2∼6
 (a total of 555) in a primary school in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province,
 China, using the Smart Handwriting Analysis Recognition Platform (SHA
RP). The assessment indicators included writing speed, writing control
, writing integration, and time-on-paper ratio. Results: All four writ
ing assessment indicators of boys and girls performed better than the 
first generation of the second-generation smart writing device (p&lt;0
.05). Comparing the writing performance ability of students in differe
nt grades:①writing speed: except for students in grade 4, students in 
all grades and all students in grades 2∼6 performed better than one ge
neration in the second-generation intelligent writing device (p&lt;0.0
5); ②writing integration: except for students in grade 2, students in 
grades 3∼6 performed better than one generation in the second-generati
on intelligent writing device (p&lt;0.05) in terms of writing integrat
ion ability;③Writing control and time-on-paper ratio: the writing cont
rol and time-on-paper ratio of students in grades 2∼6 performed better
 in the second-generation smart writing device than in the first gener
ation (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: ①On the second-generation smart writing
 device, the vast majority of students achieved superiority over the f
irst-generation device in the ability of all four writing assessment i
ndexes, but the differences between the two generations of the device 
in writing speed for grade 4 students and writing control for grade 2 
students did not reach the level of significance.②Writing speed, writi
ng control, writing integration, and time-on-paper ratio have key role
s in assessing overall writing performance, and can more comprehensive
ly and accurately reflect the differences in overall writing performan
ce between the two generations of intelligent writing devices. ③The si
gnificant advantages of the second-generation smart writing devices in
 improving students' writing ability also point to possible room for i
mprovement in specific grade levels or ability dimensions.

AB  - There is evidence that cognitive and executive functions are mental ca
pabilities that children need in order to successfully learn in school
. Serious Games (SG) and Games for Health (G4H) have been extensively 
used as tools to promote health and well-being in children. Cognitive 
games are a type of educational games which focus on enhancing cogniti
ve functioning in children with different profiles of executive functi
ons and cognitive development. We propose a system for self-regulated 
cognitive training for children, which enables the child to reflect on
 their own progress, weaknesses and strengths, and self-arrange their 
training materials, promoting self-regulated learning skills. We provi
de a narrative review of research in cognitive training for children a
nd in explainable recommendation systems for children in educational s
ettings. Based on the review, an experimental testbed is proposed to e
xplore how transparency, explainability and persuasive strategies can 
be used to promote self-regulated learning skills in children, conside
ring individual differences on abilities, preferences, and needs.

AB  - Social robots are becoming increasingly prevalent in the real world. U
nsupervised user interactions in a natural and familiar setting, such 
as the home, can reveal novel design insights and opportunities. This 
paper presents an analysis and key design insights from family-robot i
nteractions, captured via on-robot recordings during an unsupervised f
our-week in-home deployment of an autonomous reading companion robot f
or children. We analyzed interviews and 160 interaction videos involvi
ng six families who regularly interacted with a robot for four weeks. 
Throughout these interactions, we observed how the robot's expressions
 facilitated unique interactions with the child, as well as how family
 members interacted with the robot. In conclusion, we discuss five des
ign opportunities derived from our analysis of natural interactions in
 the wild.

e in Washington D.C., USA, from July 14 to 18, 2024.SIGIR serves as th
e foremost international forum for the presentation of groundbreaking 
research findings, the demonstration of innovative systems and techniq
ues, and the exploration of forwardthinking research directions in the
 field of information retrieval.This year's SIGIR is an in-person conf
erence. We believe that an in-person conference is beneficial for seve
ral reasons: it fosters direct engagement and networking opportunities
, enhances the exchange of research ideas, contributes to a more dynam
ic and productive conference experience, and nurtures our research com
munity by welcoming newcomers, providing them with the opportunity to 
become acquainted with SIGIR traditions. This decision has not been ma
de lightly. We understand the challenges that can pose in the aftermat
h of a pandemic and amidst the uncertainties of the world around us. T
o accommodate those who cannot attend, we have implemented a series of
 measures such as proxy presenters, livestreaming, and recording sessi
ons. These steps are taken to ensure that everyone has access to the v

AB  - Welcome to the third volume of ASPLOS'24: the 29th ACM International C
onference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Opera
ting Systems. This document is mostly dedicated to the 2024 fall cycle
 but also provides some statistics summarizing all three cycles.We int
roduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, most of which wer
e discussed in our previous messages from program chairs in Volume 1 a
nd 2, including: (1) significantly increasing the program committee si
ze to over 220 members (more than twice the size of last year); (2) fo
regoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings and instead making
 all decisions online; (3) overhauling the review assignment process; 
(4) developing an automated submission format violation identifier scr
ipt that uncovers, e.g., disallowed vertical space manipulations that 
"squeeze" space; (5) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice C
hairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added l
oad caused by foregoing synchronous program committee; and (6) charact
erizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantu
m computing submissions, describing how we addressed it and highlighti
ng how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Assuming rea
ders have read our previous messages, here, we will only describe diff
erences between the current cycle and the previous ones. These include
: (1) Finally unifying submission and acceptance paper formatting inst
ructions (forgoing the `jpaper' class) to rid authors of accepted pape
rs from the need to reformat; (2) Describing the methodology we employ
ed to select best papers, which we believe ensures quality and hope wi
ll persist; and (3) Reporting the ethical incidents we encountered and
 how we handled them. In the final, fourth volume, when the outcome of
 the ASPLOS'24 fall major revisions will become known, we plan to cond
uct a broader analysis of all the data we have gathered throughout the
 year.Following are some key statistics of the fall cycle: 340 submiss
ions were finalized (43% more than last year's fall count and 17% less
 than our summer cycle) of which 111 are related to accelerators/FPGAs
/GPUs, 105 to machine learning, 54 to security, 50 to datacenter/cloud
 and 50 to storage/memory; 183 (54%) submissions were promoted to the 
second review round; 39 (11.5%) papers were accepted (of which 19 were
 awarded artifact evaluation badges); 33 (9.7%) submissions were allow
ed to submit major revisions and are currently under review (these wil
l be addressed in the fourth volume of ASPLOS'24 and will be presented
 in ASPLOS'25 if accepted); 1,368 reviews were uploaded; and 4,949 com
ments were generated during online discussions, of which 4,070 were de
dicated to the submissions that made it to the second review round.Thi
s year, in the submission form, we asked authors to specify which of t
he three ASPLOS research areas are related to their submitted work. An
alyzing this data revealed that 80%, 39%, and 29% of the submissions a
re categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating 
systems, and programming languages, respectively, generating the highe
st difference we have observed across the cycles between architecture 
and the other two. About 46% of the fall submissions are "interdiscipl
inary," namely, were associated with two or more of the three areas.Ov
erall, throughout all the ASPLOS'24 cycles, we received 922 submission
s, constituting a 1.54x increase compared to last year. Our reviewers 
submitted a total of 3,634 reviews containing more than 2.6 million wo
rds, and we also generated 12,655 online comments consisting of nearly
 1.2 million words. As planned, PC members submitted an average of 15.
7 reviews and a median of 15, and external review committee (ERC) memb
ers submitted an average of 4.7 and a median of 5.We accepted 170 pape
rs thus far, written by 1100 authors, leading to an 18.4% acceptance r
ate, with the aforementioned 33 major revisions still under review. As
suming that the revision acceptance rate will be similar to that of pr
evious cycles, we estimate that ASPLOS'24 will accept nearly 200 (!) p
apers, namely, 21%–22% of the submissions.The ASPLOS'24 program consis
ts of 193 papers: the 170 papers we accepted thus far and, in addition
, 23 major revisions from the fall cycle of ASPLOS'23, which were re-r
eviewed and accepted. The full details are available in the PDF of the

AB  - Welcome to the 55th annual SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Scie
nce Education (SIGCSE TS 2024)! This year, we have returned to Portlan
d, Oregon. We hope that, like us, you are looking forward to a highly 
productive and engaging symposium that provides ample opportunity to r
enew old relationships, build new connections, and learn about the lat
est advances in our field. While we are sure that there will be a few 
surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience a
nything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, whic
h occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for thi
s year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad
 theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community
 to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse stu
dents, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undert
akings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is subs
tantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your 
biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time
 slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want
 to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland
, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself 
so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather t
han exhausted or burnt out.

AB  - Non-cognitive skills are crucial for personal and social life well-bei
ng, and such skill development can be supported by narrative-based (e.
g., storytelling) technologies. While generative AI enables interactiv
e and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engag
e with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-co
gnitive skills learning. Additionally, the benefits of AI mentorship o
n self-reflection awareness and ability in this context remain largely
 underexplored. To this end, we introduced Simulife++, an interactive 
platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows us
ers to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-b
ased characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular, we expande
d the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including
 a Sage Agent, who acts as a bystander, providing users with some pers
pectives and guidance on their choices and conversations in terms of n
on-cognitive skills to promote reflection. In a within-subject user st
udy, our quantitative results reveal that, when accompanied by Sage Ag
ent, users exhibit significantly higher levels of reflection on motiva
tion, self-perceptions, and resilience &amp; coping, along with an enh
anced experience of narrative transportation. Additionally, our qualit
ative findings suggest that Sage Agent plays a crucial role in promoti
ng reflection on non-cognitive skills, enhancing social communication 
and decision-making performance, and improving overall user experience
 within Simulife++. Multiple supportive relationships between Sage Age
nt and users were also reported. We offer design implications for the 
application of generative AI in narrative solutions and the future pot
ential of Sage Agent for non-cognitive skill development in broader so
cial contexts. Our quantitative data and code are released at https://
github.com/yzihan/Simulife.

AB  - A goal of Human Computer Interaction / Human Factors research with res
pect to creativity and cognition has been to develop principled heuris
tics that can both inform design of software, hardware and their envir
onments, as well as offer a foundation for evaluation metrics. Work in
 two areas seems to offer strong candidates for a principled design an
d evaluative approach to creativity based on neural-cognitive analysis
: (a) neuroscience in its mapping of creative acts to brain area and f
unction, and (b) human performance assessing physical activity on cogn
ition. In this paper we review the research in both these areas and pr
opose example opportunities for design and evaluation informed by this
 research. We suggest as well both that the creativity and cognition c
ommunity is ideally placed to extend neural "creativity cognition" res
earch and that working from such a foundation may significantly reconf
igure knowledge work software, hardware and work environment design.

AB  - With the increasing usage of mental health applications (MHAs), there 
is growing concern regarding their data privacy practices. Analyzing 4
37 user reviews from 83 apps, we outline users’ predominant privacy an
d security concerns with currently available apps. We then compare tho
se concerns to criteria from two prominent app evaluation websites – P
rivacy Not Included and One Mind PsyberGuide. Our findings show that M
HA users have myriad data privacy and security concerns including a us
er’s control over their own data, but these concerns do not often over
lap with those of experts from evaluation websites who focus more on i
ssues such as required password strength. We highlight this disconnect
 and propose solutions in how the mental health care ecosystem can pro
vide better guidance to MHA users and experts from the fields of priva
cy and security and mental health technology in choosing and evaluatin
g, respectively, potentially useful mental health apps.

AB  - Voice-based Conversational Agents (CAs) are increasingly being used by
 children. Through a review of 38 research papers, this work maps tren
ds, themes, and methods of empirical research on children and CAs in H
CI research over the last decade. A thematic analysis of the research 
found that work in this domain focuses on seven key topics: ascribing 
human-like qualities to CAs, CAs? support of children?s learning, the 
use and role of CAs in the home and family context, CAs? support of ch
ildren?s play, children?s storytelling with CA, issues concerning the 
collection of information revealed by CAs, and CAs designed for childr
en with differing abilities. Based on our findings, we identify the ne
eds to account for children’s intersectional identities and linguistic
 and cultural diversity and theories from multiple disciples in the de
sign of CAs, develop heuristics for child-centric interaction with CAs
, to investigate implications of CAs on social cognition and interpers
onal relationships, and to examine and design for multi-party interact
ions with CAs for different domains and contexts.

AB  - What is here called controlled natural language CNL has traditionally 
been given many different names. Especially during the last four decad
es, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are appl
ied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or 
to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations.
 Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these 
languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of la
nguages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehe
nsive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and desc
ribing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these la
nguages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the co
nceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one en
d and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The g
oal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common mo
del for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general natur
e, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area,
 and to help developers to make design decisions.

17, 2024 at the Georgia Tech Conference Center and Hotel in Atlanta, G
eorgia.As researchers, especially those of us focused on equity, freed
om, and justice, our job is to give language to and make meaning of th
e joy, trauma, and unwavering spirit of the most vulnerable and margin
alized among us. We don't do this simply to shed light but to influenc
e change. We stand when others are forced to sit and speak when others
 are silenced. For many of us, the past several years have rendered ou
r usual tools ineffective, and often we find ourselves seated, scared 
to stand, and essentially silenced as we search for new language to de
scribe old problems. We increasingly, and rightfully, feel frustrate..
. powerles... angry. Unfortunately, we sometimes allow these feelings 
to lead us to inaction. However, as the Black feminist scholar Audre L
orde wrote in her masterpiece, Sister Outsider, anger, directed in pro
ductive ways, can be transformative.

AB  - Social robots are emerging as learning companions for children, and re
search shows that they facilitate the development of interest and lear
ning even through brief interactions. However, little is known about h
ow such technologies might support these goals in authentic environmen
ts over long-term periods of use and interaction. We designed a learni
ng companion robot capable of supporting children reading popular-scie
nce books by expressing social and informational commentaries. We depl
oyed the robot in homes of 14 families with children aged 10–12 for fo
ur weeks during the summer. Our analysis revealed critical factors tha
t affected children’s long-term engagement and adoption of the robot, 
including external factors such as vacations, family visits, and extra
curricular activities; family/parental involvement; and children’s ind
ividual interests. We present four in-depth cases that illustrate thes
e factors and demonstrate their impact on children’s reading experienc
es and discuss the implications of our findings for robot design.

AB  - Experiential training, where mental health professionals practice thei
r learned skills, remains the most costly component of therapeutic tra
ining. We introduce Pin-MI, a video-call-based tool that supports expe
riential learning of counseling skills used in motivational interviewi
ng (MI)through interactive role-play as client and counselor. In Pin-M
I, counselors annotate, or “pin” the important moments in their role-p
lay sessions in real-time. The pins are then used post-session to faci
litate a reflective learning process, in which both client and counsel
or can provide feedback about what went well or poorly during each pin
ned moment. We discuss the design of Pin-MI and a qualitative evaluati
on with a set of healthcare professionals learning MI. Our evaluation 
suggests that Pin-MI helped users develop empathy, be more aware of th
eir skill usage, guaranteed immediate and targeted feedback, and helpe
d users correct misconceptions about their performance. We discuss imp
lications for the design of experiential training tools for learning c
ounseling skills.

AB  - Social emotional skills are foundational competencies upon which child
ren draw throughout their lives. This work investigates current, comme
rcially available experiences for social emotional learning (SEL) thro
ugh conversational agents (CAs). Specifically, we reviewed 3,767 Skill
s available in the "Kids" category of the Alexa Skills Marketplace and
 found 42 working Skills with connections to SEL. We found that the mo
st common scenarios these Skills sought to support were: active listen
ing, emotional wellbeing, conversation with other people, and politene
ss. The interaction patterns used by these Skills distilled into a tax
onomy of styles we labeled: The Delegator, The Lecturer, The Bulldozer
, and The One-Track Mind. We found that, collectively, these Skills pr
ovide shallow experiences and lack contingent feedback. To examine the
 gap between current offerings and families' needs, we also conducted 
26 interviews with parents to probe parents' ideas about CAs supportin
g children's SEL. Parents see potential for CAs to support children in
 four concrete ways, including attuning to others, cultivating curiosi
ty, reinforcing politeness, and developing emotional awareness. Despit
e their optimism about these opportunities, parents expressed skeptici
sm about CAs' impoverished conversational abilities and worry about CA
s advancing values and behavioral norms that are at odds with their ow
n.

AB  - With the aim of better scaffolding discussion to improve learning in a
 MOOC context, this work investigates what kinds of discussion behavio
rs contribute to learning. We explored whether engaging in higher-orde
r thinking behaviors results in more learning than paying general or f
ocused attention to course materials. In order to evaluate whether to 
attribute the effect to engagement in the associated behaviors versus 
persistent characteristics of the students, we adopted two approaches.
 First, we used propensity score matching to pair students who exhibit
 a similar level of involvement in other course activities. Second, we
 explored individual variation in engagement in higher-order thinking 
behaviors across weeks. The results of both analyses support the attri
bution of the effect to the behavioral interpretation. A further analy
sis using LDA applied to course materials suggests that more social or
iented topics triggered richer discussion than more biopsychology orie
nted topics.

AB  - Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Co
operative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSC
W community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference
 was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal du
ring the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portlan
d provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the pr
emier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technolog
ies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Brin
ging together top researchers and practitioners from academia and indu
stry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical c
hallenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and li
fe activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research me
thodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of 
novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design prac
tice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research tha
t advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design o
f systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our con
ference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's w
ork, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural di
versity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "
revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve s
ubmitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final a
cceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with 
a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidanc
e of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW progr
am ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for present
ation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published 
in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In additio
n, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Li
li Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "
Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will fea
ture Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The 
Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King'
s College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award f
or their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."
