abstract = {Purpose of the review: Traditional autism screening and diagnosis has some limitations, they cannot meet the needs of large-scale screening and diagnosis. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to clinical medicine is a hot research topic recently, especially in mental health. China and international explorations of autism intelligent recognition technology have accumulated rich results in the fields of brain imaging, expression, eye movement and action, multimode, and classical task behaviour. Meanwhile, a variety of intelligent therapeutic robots based on modal interaction are also developed. This paper reviews the shortcomings of the traditional diagnostic techniques for autism and the current research status of AI in the diagnosis and treatment, hope to provide a reference for relevant research on Autism applications based on AI.Research methods: Literature on the application of AI in autism screening diagnosis and intervention in recent years was searched through literature navigation, and we analyse the aspects of autism screening, diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.Research conclusion: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it has become possible to use intelligent methods to carry out early large-scale senseless screening and diagnosis of Autism. In the future, research should focus on building an intelligent medical screening and diagnosis system for autism&nbsp;patient, developing screening tools and constructing an intelligent identification model for patients that integrates multimode data.},

abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. ASD affects individuals across various aspects of their lives, including their cognitive, social, and motor skills. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes and providing appropriate support to individuals with ASD. Handwriting is an essential skill that children develop early in life, and it provides valuable insights into their motor control, coordination, and cognitive processes. Good handwriting is crucial for academic progress, social and communicative development, and development of self-esteem. By identifying the handwriting characteristics exhibited by ASD children, we aim to develop a reliable and objective method for detecting ASD. We aim to identify the handwriting characteristics associated with ASD using deep learning techniques. The characteristics of Chinese characters, such as straight lines and turns, are considered in analyzing the writing characteristics of ASD children. We present a dataset of ASD children's handwriting in Traditional Chinese and fine-tunes three models to build a classification model. Experiment results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between the handwriting of ASD children and typically developing children, achieving F1 score of 93.6%. The study provides valuable insights into handwriting characteristics in ASD and suggests directions for future research in this area.},

abstract = {This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), manifested in the forms of technologies, systems, tools, and applications, has advanced rapidly, especially in recent years. It has permeated many aspects of human behavior and nearly all sectors of society, such as healthcare and education. In the context of early childhood education (ECE), AI has afforded valuable opportunities that directly and indirectly enhance children’s learning and development. While there are already two existing reviews of the literature on AI in ECE, they show either a lack of descriptive information concerning selected studies or inconsistencies between inclusion/exclusion criteria and selected studies, thereby raising concerns about their rigor. Representing a more methodologically rigorous effort and a significant contribution to the field of AI in ECE, this scoping study aimed to achieve three main goals: (1) “mapping” the global landscape of the current extent, range, and nature of relevant studies on the affordances of AI for use in ECE, (2) identifying potential research gaps, and (3) charting future research directions. Specifically, it addressed this overarching research question: What is the global landscape of the current state of knowledge concerning the affordances of AI for use in ECE? Specifically, the state of knowledge here refers to three aspects: (1) extent, (2) range, and (3) nature. First, regarding the extent aspect, the empirical knowledge was derived from 18 research articles in 11 countries and 16 peer-reviewed academic journals between 2005 and 2023, with 14 of these articles published in the past four years (2020–2023). Second, with respect to the range of study populations, it covered 15,081 children in early childhood (ages 2 to 8 years) across these 11 countries. Third, thematic analysis of these studies revealed four areas of AI affordances: (1) AI as tangible and intangible tools for interactive learning and information retrieval, (2) AI as technology for predicting/classifying children’s conditions, (3) AI as the object for learning by adapting to and personalizing children’s learning, and (4) AI as the subject for children's learning about it. Based on these findings, this scoping review identified three research gaps for future studies: (1) interviewing and/or surveying education stakeholders (parents, educators, policymakers) to explore the affordances of appropriate AI for use with, by, and for children bearing ethical considerations; (2) conducting group comparisons to investigate contextual factors contributing to the “AI divide” among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds; and (3) comparing sociocultural influences on AI use in ECE across cultures.},

abstract = {In pediatric healthcare in the Philippines, practical communication tools are essential for children facing challenges in conventional expression. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a transformative solution that enables non-verbal pediatric patients to articulate their thoughts and emotions effectively. The study explores 49 papers from a pool of 182, uncovering critical challenges and innovative solutions on a global scale. The transformative impact of Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology is highlighted, as well as the essential role of transition services in preparing individuals for employment. The study also examines the power of self-advocacy training, communication boards, and mobile AAC software in empowering students and fostering socialization. A hierarchical conceptual framework is proposed to guide the development of the Filipino-based AAC mobile application that integrates contextual and mediating variables. The implications of this research are broad, affecting education, healthcare, and technology sectors. It emphasizes the importance of continuous training and support for educators, caregivers, and individuals with disabilities. Overall, this research significantly advances our understanding of AAC and lays the groundwork for practical interventions that promote inclusivity for individuals with communication challenges.},

abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) develops rapidly, equipping students with basic knowledge of GenAI at the secondary school level is beneficial. However, few subjects in special schools cover AI-related topics, and it remains unclear how students with special educational needs (SEN) perceive, learn, and use AI. In this study, we documented the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) learning experience of seven students from two special schools who participated in a series of game design workshops. We analysed their learning process, usage, and perspectives of text-to-image GenAI through video analysis, questionnaire, and evaluation of design outputs. Our findings reveal the students' willingness to learn and utilise AI technology. This AI experience allows students, especially those who struggle with fine motor skills, to translate their ideas into digital images. Moreover, the text-to-image interaction enhances students' ability to convey their ideas in writing and develop their skills in conceptualisation. We also summarised significant human-AI interaction challenges, including difficulties with typing, Chinese and English spelling, and prompt writing. We conclude with recommendations for designing future inclusive human-AI interaction experiences for students with SEN in China.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2024, held July 18-20, 2024 at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.The Learning at Scale conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. During the last few years, new opportunities for scaling up learning have emerged, like hybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, and informal learning enabled by all sorts of platforms (e.g., gamified language learning, citizen science communities, and collaborative programming communities). In the recent two years, the unprecedented development of generative AI has brought profound opportunities to scale the teaching and learning experiences, with the goal of enhancing learning for the increasingly diverse group of learners in both formal and informal contexts. L@S has evolved along with these emergent massive learning scenarios and opportunities and is today one of the most prominent venues for discussion of the highest quality of research on how learning and teaching can be transformed at scale, in diverse learning environments.The theme of L@S 2024 is Scaling Learning in the Age of AI. Rapid advances in AI have created new opportunities but also challenges for the Learning@Scale community. The advances in generative AI show potential to enhance pedagogical practices and the efficacy of learning at scale. This has led to an unprecedented level of interest in employing generative AI for scaling tutoring and feedback. The prevalence of such tools calls for new practices and understanding on how AI-based methods should be designed and developed to enhance the experiences and outcomes of teachers and learners.Learning@Scale 2024 solicits empirical and theoretical papers on, but not limited to, the following topics (in no particular order): 1) Instruction at scale: studies that examine how teachers and educators scale their instructions, what aspects of instruction could be scaled effectively, and which of these instructional strategies are the most effective for learning. 2) Interventions at scale: studies that examine the effects of interventions on student learning and performance when implemented at scale. We welcome studies that use both qualitative and quantitative methods. 3) The use of generative AI to scale learning: studies that investigate stakeholders' experiences with generative AI, students' and teachers' interactions with generative AI, and the potentials and limitations of using generative AI in education. 4) Systems and tools to support learning at scale: research that designs and develops systems and tools to support learning at scale. For example, this involves scaling learning through web-based systems, MOOCs, visualization, intelligent tutoring systems, gamification, immersive techniques (AR/VR/MR), mobile technologies, tangible interfaces, and various other technologies. 5) The evaluation of existing learning at scale systems and online learning environments using but not limited to the above-mentioned technologies. 6) Methods and algorithms that model learner behavior: research that contributes methods, algorithms, and pipelines that process large student data to enhance learning at scale. 7) Scaling learning in informal contexts: studies that explore how people take advantage of online environments to pursue their interests informally. 8) Review and synthesis of existing literature related to learning at scale. 9) Empirical studies and interventions that address equity, trust, algorithmic transparency and explainability, fairness and bias when using AI in education. 10) Research that addresses accessibility in learning at scale contexts. 11) Design and deployment of learning at scale systems for learners from underrepresented groups.},

abstract = {Driving is essential for many people in developed countries to achieve independence. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), in addition to having social skill deficits, may experience difficulty in learning to drive due to deficits in attention-shifting, performing sequential tasks, integrating visual-motor responses, and coordinating motor response. Lacking confidence and feeling anxiety further exacerbates these concerns. While there is a growing body of research regarding assessment of driving behavior or comparisons of driving behaviors between individuals with and without ASD, there is a lack of driving simulator that is catered toward the needs of individuals with ASD. We present the development of a novel closed-loop adaptive Virtual Reality (VR) driving simulator for individuals with ASD that can infer one's engagement based on his/her physiological responses and adapts driving task difficulty based on engagement level in real-time. We believe that this simulator will provide opportunities for learning driving skills in a safe and individualized environment to individuals with ASD and help them with independent living. We also conducted a small user study with teenagers with ASD to demonstrate the feasibility and tolerability of such a driving simulator. Preliminary results showed that the participants found the engagement-sensitive system more engaging and more enjoyable than a purely performance-sensitive system. These findings could support future work into driving simulator technologies, which could provide opportunities to practice driving skills in cost-effective, supportive, and safe environments.},

abstract = {Social robots, particularly in assisting children with autism, have exhibited positive impacts on mental health. While prior studies concentrated on social robots in the Global North, there’s limited exploration in the Global South. It’s essential to comprehend special educators’ perspectives for effective integration in resource-constrained settings. Our mixed-methods approach, involving interviews, workshops, and a panel discussion with 25 educators in India, uncovers challenges and opportunities in integrating social robots into autism interventions. The findings highlight the urgent need to democratise the benefits of social robotics. Special educators express concerns about their functional capacity and fear potential redundancy due to the replacement of human efforts by social robots. Despite initial scepticism, professionals suggest various ways to incorporate social robots, emphasising the importance of technological innovation in reshaping and enhancing their roles in autism therapy. We discuss the implications of these findings for developing context-aware solutions and policy-level initiatives necessary in resource-constrained settings.},

abstract = {People with cognitive and learning disabilities make up a significant percentage of the general population. Among the difficulties of this group, it is frequent that they present a poor comprehension of texts. The easy-to-read guidelines facilitate the comprehension of texts but adapting texts according to these rules is a time-consuming manual labour. There are automatic approaches to simplify texts and assess difficulty after the text is published, but there is not a tool to help writers and editors in the editorial process. In this paper a platform is presented to assist in this process by visually identifying problematic elements indicated in the guidelines. This approach allows publishers to do their job more efficiently.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects many people; the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 59 children are currently identified with ASD in the United States. Although it is difficult to generalize about people with ASD due to their heterogeneity, many share an affinity for technologies; as such, numerous academic endeavors and commercial products have focused on the creation of interactive technologies for ASD. In this article, we present findings from 19 interviews and 230 surveys with parents, teachers, and therapists who had children with ASD in their care and had considered or used interactive technologies with those children. We aimed to understand how interactive technologies were used, perceived, desired, and discovered. Findings of use and perception included the following: participants had tried a wide range of commercially available technologies but had very few reported products in common, products were limited to commercial mobile-based apps, and apps were typically perceived positively. In regard to desires, participants hoped for future technologies on diverse platforms (e.g., robots, virtual reality) with more consideration given to personalization, customization, and incorporation of audio and video. Findings about discovery included the following: participants chose technologies in an information-poor environment, and although there are many academic projects aimed at participants’ desires, no participants reported any experience working with researchers. Implications of this study include the need for a recommendation and information sharing system to help people choose and discover appropriate and effective interactive technologies that are a good fit for their child. This work also pointed to a need for such a system to include findings from lab (experimental and usability) studies of commercially available interactive technologies to provide measures of efficacy and usability. Our envisioned system could also potentially help academic researchers with outreach to wider audiences.},

We conducted a two-phase study: a co-design workshop to understand the needs of the target population and potential roles of CAs to support communication skill training, and a subsequent evaluation session with a CA prototype by a group of SLPs. Our findings highlighted the importance of designing accessibility, personalization, and motivation features of CAs with greater depth, augmentation, and precision, emphasizing the need for multiple interaction modalities, real-time and deeply tailored personalization, and more intrinsic motivational strategies. Our work contributes to the design and application of inclusive CAs in communication therapy, with implications for clinical and home settings.},

abstract = {Impairment in pragmatic language is one of the most noticeable symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Abnormal activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a critical language area associated with pragmatic meaning processing, has been repeatedly reported in individuals with ASD. While brain areas are connected via&nbsp;networks, few studies have examined how the intrinsic network of IFG is connected atypically to other brain areas in ASD participants&nbsp;compared to typical controls. To elucidate the putative brain network underlying IFG, we compared the resting-state functional connectivity in ASD and typically developing children. A two-sample t-test based on 16 autistic and 16 typically developing children revealed that both LIFG and RIFG had aberrant functional connectivity. Specifically, compared to the typically developing children, the ASD group had lower pragmatic language performance and were associated with weaker connectivity between LIFG and inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part (IFGoperc), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and thalamus (THA), but increased functional connectivity between LIFG and cingulate gyrus (CG). Regarding RIFG, our study revealed reduced functional connectivity between RIFG and the fusiform (FFG), lingual gyrus (LING), pons, and cuneus (CUN), but increased functional connectivity between RIFG and the middle temporal gyrus (MTG). This altered brain network is closely linked to the classical network of Theory of mind (ToM) network, which provides a rationale for understanding pragmatic language impairment in autism. Based on the results of functional connectivity, this study discussed the possible reasons of pragmatic impairment in children with autism in the scope of ToM, and provided suggestions for the neural mechanism, clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation of children with autism who have pragmatic disorders.},

This work presents a prototype application that generates situation-specific communication boards formed by a combination of descriptive, narrative, and semantic related words and phrases inferred automatically from photographs. Through semi-structured interviews with AAC professionals, we investigate how this prototype was used to support communication and language learning in naturalistic school and therapy settings. We find that the immediacy of vocabulary reduces conversation partners’ workload, opens up opportunities for AAC stimulation, and facilitates symbolic understanding and sentence construction. We contribute a nuanced understanding of how vocabularies generated automatically from photographs can support individuals with complex communication needs in using and learning symbolic AAC, offering insights into the design of automatic vocabulary generation methods and interfaces to better support various scenarios of use and goals.},

abstract = {Reading skills are crucial for students' success in education and beyond. However, reading proficiency among K-12 students has been declining globally, including in Sweden, leaving many underprepared for post-secondary education. Additionally, an increasing number of students have reading disorders, such as dyslexia, which require support. Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) technologies, like ChatGPT, may offer new opportunities to improve reading practices by enhancing the readability of educational texts. This study investigates whether ChatGPT-4 can simplify academic texts and which prompting strategies are most effective. We tasked ChatGPT to re-write 136 academic texts using four prompting approaches: Standard, Meta, Roleplay, and Chain-of-Thought. All four approaches improved text readability, with Meta performing the best overall and the Standard prompt sometimes creating texts that were less readable than the original. This study found variability in the simplified texts, suggesting that different strategies should be used based on the specific needs of individual learners. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of genAI tools, like ChatGPT, to improve the accessibility of academic texts, offering valuable support for students with reading difficulties and promoting more equitable learning opportunities.},

abstract = {Generative AI (AI) has become ubiquitous in both daily and professional life, with emerging research demonstrating its potential as a tool for accessibility. Neurodivergent people, often left out by existing accessibility technologies, develop their own ways of navigating normative expectations. GAI offers new opportunities for access, but it is important to understand how neurodivergent “power users”—successful early adopters—engage with it and the challenges they face. Further, we must understand how marginalization and intersectional identities influence their interactions with GAI. Our autoethnography, enhanced by privacy-preserving GAI-based diaries and interviews, reveals the intricacies of using GAI to navigate normative environments and expectations. Our findings demonstrate how GAI can both support and complicate tasks like code-switching, emotional regulation, and accessing information. We show that GAI can help neurodivergent users to reclaim their agency in systems that diminish their autonomy and self-determination. However, challenges such as balancing authentic self-expression with societal conformity, alongside other risks, create barriers to realizing GAI’s full potential for accessibility.},

abstract = {In the last decade, deep learning and word embeddings have made significant impacts on information retrieval (IR) by adding techniques based in neural networks and language models. At the same time, certain search modalities such as neural IR and conversational search have become more popular. This book, written by international academic and industry experts, brings the field up to date with detailed discussions of these new approaches and techniques. The book is organized in three sections: Foundations, Adaptations and Concerns, and Verticals.Under Foundations, we address topics that form the basic structure of any modern IR system, including recommender systems. These new techniques are developed to augment indexing, retrieval, and ranking. Neural IR, recommender systems, evaluation, query-driven functionality, and knowledge graphs are covered in this section.IR systems need to adapt to specific user characteristics and preferences, and techniques that were considered too niche a few years ago are now a matter of system design consideration. The Adaptations and Concerns section covers the following topics: conversational search, cross-language retrieval, temporal extraction and retrieval, bias in retrieval systems, and privacy in search.While web search engines are the most popular information access point, there are cases where specific verticals provide a better experience in terms of content and relevance. The Verticals section describes eCommerce, professional search, personal collections, music retrieval, and biomedicine as examples.}

abstract = {One of the key challenges faced by autistic children is understanding social affordances in complex environments, which further impacts their ability to respond appropriately to social signals. In traffic scenarios, this impairment can even lead to safety concerns. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-simulated immersive projection environment designed to improve this ability in autistic children while ensuring their safety. We first propose 17 design considerations across four major categories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous research. Next, we developed a system called AIRoad, which leverages LLMs to simulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit multimodal social signals. AIRoad helps autistic children bridge the gap in recognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriate responses through various stimuli. A user study involving 14 participants demonstrated that this technology effectively engages autistic children and leads to significant improvements in their comprehension of social affordances in traffic scenarios. Additionally, parents reported high perceived usability of the system. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLM technology with immersive environments for the functional rehabilitation of autistic children in the future.},

We adopted the technology probe design method to investigate key design elements that contribute to the usefulness of ASL recommendations and user autonomy in AI-mediated technologies. Findings of a semi-structured interview study show that ASL recommendations are considered useful when they align with users’ needs, and offer diversity and serendipity. In addition, participants desire more control over automatic recommendations, but more autonomy does not always guarantee greater user satisfaction. We conclude with design insights for future AI-mediated communication technologies for parent-child interactions.},

Positioned between the interactive human reader and the passive reading pen, the reading robot not only sustained engagement for the longest duration but also achieved the highest comprehension scores. The robot effectively balanced emotional arousal and stress levels, facilitating enhanced cognitive processing and information retention. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between family technology use and both engagement and comprehension with the robot.

abstract = {Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVE) have shown potential to be an effective social skill training platform for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) to learn and practice collaborative and communication skills through peer interactions. However, most existing CVE systems require that appropriately matched partners be available at the same time to promote interaction, which limits their applicability to some community settings due to scheduling constraints. A second shortcoming of these more naturalistic peer-based designs is the intensive resources required to manually code the unrestricted conversations that occurred during the peer-based interactions. To preserve the benefits of CVE-based platforms and mitigate some of the resource limitations related to peer availability, we developed an Intelligent Collaborative Haptic-Gripper System (INC-Hg). This system provides an intelligent agent partner who can understand, communicate, and haptically interact with the user, without requiring the presence of another human peer. The INC-Hg operates in real time and thus is able to perform collaborative training tasks at any time and at the user's pace. INC-Hg can also record the real-time data regarding spoken language and task performance, thereby greatly reducing the resource burden of communication and interaction performance analysis. A preliminary usability study with 10 participants with ASD (ages 8–12 years) indicated that the system could classify the participant's utterances into five classes with an accuracy of 70.34%, which suggested the potential of INC-Hg to automatically recognize and analyze conversational content. The results also indicated high accuracies of the agent to initiate a conversation (97.56%) and respond to the participants (86.52%), suggesting the capability of the agent to conduct proper conversations with the participants. Compared to the results of human-to-human collaborative tasks, the human-to-agent mode achieved higher average collaborative operation ratio (61% compared to 40%) and comparable average frequencies for Initiations and Responses among the participants with ASD. These results offer preliminary support as well as areas of improvement regarding the agent's ability to respond to participants, work with participants to complete tasks, engage in back-and-forth conversations, and support the potential of the agent to be a useful partner for individuals with ASD completing CVE tasks.},

abstract = {End-users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) have diverse speech, cognitive, and motor abilities. AAC’s heterogeneous user groups and persistent usability issues create a challenging and rich design space. Our work takes a value-sensitive design (VSD) approach to develop a stakeholder value framework that describes stakeholders’ multi-dimensional roles and values. Our framework is based on (1) an empirical investigation—a survey and interviews—of AAC users and AAC conversation partners and (2) a conceptual investigation—a systematic literature review—of AAC HCI research. Emergent value themes were ease, fulfillment, acceptance, adaptation, safety, performance, autonomy, justice, design fulfillment, and business fulfillment. These themes inform how AAC end-users engage with AAC and how indirect stakeholders, such as AAC technologists, make choices that ultimately impact AAC users. Our stakeholder value framework and rich descriptions of AAC socio-technical barriers can inform AAC designers in making ethically sound decisions that support, not hinder, stakeholder values.},

abstract = {The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive overview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, and decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and each other in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors with the goal to support humans in various domains.Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved.In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated by different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human-agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism or games.}

abstract = {Social robots' contributions to education are notorious but, in times, limited by the difficulty in their programming by regular teachers. Our framework named R-CASTLE aims to overcome this problem by providing the teachers with an easy way to program their content and the robot's behavior through a graphical interface. However, the robot's behavior adaptation algorithm maybe still not the best intuitive method for teachers' understanding. Fuzzy systems have the advantage of being modeled in a more human-like way than other methods due to their implementation based on linguistic variables and terms. Thus, fuzzy modeling for robot behavior adaptation in educational children-robot interactions is proposed for this framework. The modeling resulted in an adaptation algorithm that considers a multimodal and autonomous assessment of the students' skills: attention, communication, and learning. Furthermore, preliminary experiments were performed considering videos with the robot in a school environment. The adaptation was set to change the content approach difficulty to produce a suitably challenging behavior according to each students' reactions. Results were compared to a Rule-Based adaptive method. The fuzzy modeling showed similar accuracy to the ruled-based method with a suggestion of a more intuitive interpretation of the process.},

This work presents a prototype application that generates situation-specific communication boards formed by a combination of descriptive, narrative, and semantic related words and phrases inferred automatically from photographs. Through semi-structured interviews with AAC professionals, we investigate how this prototype was used to support communication and language learning in naturalistic school and therapy settings. We find that the immediacy of vocabulary reduces conversation partners’ workload, opens up opportunities for AAC stimulation, and facilitates symbolic understanding and sentence construction. We contribute a nuanced understanding of how vocabularies generated automatically from photographs can support individuals with complex communication needs in using and learning symbolic AAC, offering insights into the design of automatic vocabulary generation methods and interfaces to better support various scenarios of use and goals.},

However, little work has been done to understand how online governance structures might support (or hinder) such learning. Using mixed-methods research, we report findings from a 2-year, in-the-wild study of 8–13 year olds on a custom multiplayer Minecraft server. The two-part study focuses on the design of youth-centered models of community governance drawn from evidence-based offline practices in the prevention and learning sciences. Preliminary results point to a set of socio-technical design approaches shaping player behavior while also supporting youth interest in Minecraft-like online environments. More broadly, the findings suggest an alternative vision of youth’s capacity for ownership and control of mechanisms shaping the culture and climate of their online communities: managing player behavior while challenging current norms around adult control and surveillance of youth activity.},

abstract = {We are delighted to welcome you to Melbourne, Australia for ACM Multimedia 2024, the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and its surrounding regions.},

Originally, UbiComp/ISWC was scheduled to take place in Melbourne in 2021. However, due to the significant impact of COVID-19, our community decided to postpone conferences taking place in their traditional form until last year, when UbiComp took place as an in-person event in Mexico. Now, in 2024 we look to consolidate the strength and ties in our community by having another fully in-person event and hoping to welcome a new generation of researchers to meet and explore the wonderful people that make up our community.},

abstract = {The goal of the study is to reveal the correlation between speech peculiarities and different aspects of development of children with autism spectrum disorders. The participants in the study were 28 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) aged 4-11 years and 64 adults - listening to children's speech samples. Children with ASD were divided into two groups: ASD-1 - ASD is the leading symptom (F84, n=17); children assigned to ASD-2 (n=11) had other disorders accompanied by ASD symptomatology (F83 + F84). Recording of children's speech and behavior was carried out in the most similar situations: a dialogue with the experimenter, viewing pictures and retelling a story about them or answers to questions, book reading. The child's psychophysiological characteristics were estimated according to the method which includes determining the leading hemisphere by speech (dichotic listening test - DLT), phonemic hearing, and the profile of lateral functional asymmetry (PLFA). All tasks and the time of the study were adapted to the child's capacities. The study analyzed the level of speech formation in 4-11 year-old children with ASD, identified direct and indirect relationships between the features of early development, its psychophysiological indicators, and the speech development level at the time of the study. The ability of adults to recognize the psychoneurological state of children via their speech is determined. The results of the study support the need to increase focus on and understanding of the language strengths and weaknesses in children with ASD and an individual approach to teaching children.},

abstract = {Current mechanisms for adopting and supporting high-tech augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) within special-education appear limited in their success, despite recognition of the potential benefits they represent for young emerging communicators. Prior research in this field has been restricted to discrete survey or interview methodologies. We present a five-month mixed-methods ethnographic study in a special-education school to explore the facilitators and barriers experienced by those using technology, with children who have little or no functional speech, to stimulate communication and language comprehension. Our analysis supports the outcomes of earlier studies, but also furnishes novel insights into the scale and urgency of addressing the problem—with implications for user-centred design within this community. We highlight infrastructure, policy, and recruitment deficits, and propose a two-fold solution: (i) an increase in engagement with this population through the provision of enhanced, user-centred support; and (ii) induction of the cross-disciplinary role of Assistive Technologist, to serve as mediator between teacher, aided communicator, and their assistive technology. This work represents a contribution towards establishing more effective operational, interactional, and pedagogical support for learners using high-tech communication devices.},

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

abstract = {Sentence Simplification (SS) aims to modify a sentence in order to make it easier to read and understand. In order to do so, several rewriting transformations can be performed such as replacement, reordering, and splitting. Executing these transformations while keeping sentences grammatical, preserving their main idea, and generating simpler output, is a challenging and still far from solved problem. In this article, we survey research on SS, focusing on approaches that attempt to learn how to simplify using corpora of aligned original-simplified sentence pairs in English, which is the dominant paradigm nowadays. We also include a benchmark of different approaches on common data sets so as to compare them and highlight their strengths and limitations. We expect that this survey will serve as a starting point for researchers interested in the task and help spark new ideas for future developments.},

abstract = {Objective: Through computerised analysis of writing ability assessment data, the aim was to compare the effectiveness of two generations of hardware smart writing devices in the application of children's writing performance ability from 6 to 12 years of age, and to provide data support for accurate screening and assessment of those with writing difficulties. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the writing performance ability of primary school students in grades 2∼6 (a total of 555) in a primary school in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, China, using the Smart Handwriting Analysis Recognition Platform (SHARP). The assessment indicators included writing speed, writing control, writing integration, and time-on-paper ratio. Results: All four writing assessment indicators of boys and girls performed better than the first generation of the second-generation smart writing device (p&lt;0.05). Comparing the writing performance ability of students in different grades:①writing speed: except for students in grade 4, students in all grades and all students in grades 2∼6 performed better than one generation in the second-generation intelligent writing device (p&lt;0.05); ②writing integration: except for students in grade 2, students in grades 3∼6 performed better than one generation in the second-generation intelligent writing device (p&lt;0.05) in terms of writing integration ability;③Writing control and time-on-paper ratio: the writing control and time-on-paper ratio of students in grades 2∼6 performed better in the second-generation smart writing device than in the first generation (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: ①On the second-generation smart writing device, the vast majority of students achieved superiority over the first-generation device in the ability of all four writing assessment indexes, but the differences between the two generations of the device in writing speed for grade 4 students and writing control for grade 2 students did not reach the level of significance.②Writing speed, writing control, writing integration, and time-on-paper ratio have key roles in assessing overall writing performance, and can more comprehensively and accurately reflect the differences in overall writing performance between the two generations of intelligent writing devices. ③The significant advantages of the second-generation smart writing devices in improving students' writing ability also point to possible room for improvement in specific grade levels or ability dimensions.},

Serious Games (SG) and Games for Health (G4H) have been extensively used as tools to promote health and well-being in children. Cognitive games are a type of educational games which focus on enhancing cognitive functioning in children with different profiles of executive functions and cognitive development. We propose a system for self-regulated cognitive training for children, which enables the child to reflect on their own progress, weaknesses and strengths, and self-arrange their training materials, promoting self-regulated learning skills. We provide a narrative review of research in cognitive training for children and in explainable recommendation systems for children in educational settings. Based on the review, an experimental testbed is proposed to explore how transparency, explainability and persuasive strategies can be used to promote self-regulated learning skills in children, considering individual differences on abilities, preferences, and needs.},

Unsupervised user interactions in a natural and familiar setting, such as the home, can reveal novel design insights and opportunities. This paper presents an analysis and key design insights from family-robot interactions, captured via on-robot recordings during an unsupervised four-week in-home deployment of an autonomous reading companion robot for children. We analyzed interviews and 160 interaction videos involving six families who regularly interacted with a robot for four weeks. Throughout these interactions, we observed how the robot's expressions facilitated unique interactions with the child, as well as how family members interacted with the robot. In conclusion, we discuss five design opportunities derived from our analysis of natural interactions in the wild.},

abstract = {Welcome to the third volume of ASPLOS'24: the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. This document is mostly dedicated to the 2024 fall cycle but also provides some statistics summarizing all three cycles.We introduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, most of which were discussed in our previous messages from program chairs in Volume 1 and 2, including: (1) significantly increasing the program committee size to over 220 members (more than twice the size of last year); (2) foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings and instead making all decisions online; (3) overhauling the review assignment process; (4) developing an automated submission format violation identifier script that uncovers, e.g., disallowed vertical space manipulations that "squeeze" space; (5) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee; and (6) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Assuming readers have read our previous messages, here, we will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous ones. These include: (1) Finally unifying submission and acceptance paper formatting instructions (forgoing the `jpaper' class) to rid authors of accepted papers from the need to reformat; (2) Describing the methodology we employed to select best papers, which we believe ensures quality and hope will persist; and (3) Reporting the ethical incidents we encountered and how we handled them. In the final, fourth volume, when the outcome of the ASPLOS'24 fall major revisions will become known, we plan to conduct a broader analysis of all the data we have gathered throughout the year.Following are some key statistics of the fall cycle: 340 submissions were finalized (43% more than last year's fall count and 17% less than our summer cycle) of which 111 are related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 105 to machine learning, 54 to security, 50 to datacenter/cloud and 50 to storage/memory; 183 (54%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 39 (11.5%) papers were accepted (of which 19 were awarded artifact evaluation badges); 33 (9.7%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions and are currently under review (these will be addressed in the fourth volume of ASPLOS'24 and will be presented in ASPLOS'25 if accepted); 1,368 reviews were uploaded; and 4,949 comments were generated during online discussions, of which 4,070 were dedicated to the submissions that made it to the second review round.This year, in the submission form, we asked authors to specify which of the three ASPLOS research areas are related to their submitted work. Analyzing this data revealed that 80%, 39%, and 29% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, generating the highest difference we have observed across the cycles between architecture and the other two. About 46% of the fall submissions are "interdisciplinary," namely, were associated with two or more of the three areas.Overall, throughout all the ASPLOS'24 cycles, we received 922 submissions, constituting a 1.54x increase compared to last year. Our reviewers submitted a total of 3,634 reviews containing more than 2.6 million words, and we also generated 12,655 online comments consisting of nearly 1.2 million words. As planned, PC members submitted an average of 15.7 reviews and a median of 15, and external review committee (ERC) members submitted an average of 4.7 and a median of 5.We accepted 170 papers thus far, written by 1100 authors, leading to an 18.4% acceptance rate, with the aforementioned 33 major revisions still under review. Assuming that the revision acceptance rate will be similar to that of previous cycles, we estimate that ASPLOS'24 will accept nearly 200 (!) papers, namely, 21%–22% of the submissions.The ASPLOS'24 program consists of 193 papers: the 170 papers we accepted thus far and, in addition, 23 major revisions from the fall cycle of ASPLOS'23, which were re-reviewed and accepted.

While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},

abstract = {Non-cognitive skills are crucial for personal and social life well-being, and such skill development can be supported by narrative-based (e.g., storytelling) technologies. While generative AI enables interactive and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-cognitive skills learning. Additionally, the benefits of AI mentorship on self-reflection awareness and ability in this context remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduced Simulife++, an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows users to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-based characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular, we expanded the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including a Sage Agent, who acts as a bystander, providing users with some perspectives and guidance on their choices and conversations in terms of non-cognitive skills to promote reflection. In a within-subject user study, our quantitative results reveal that, when accompanied by Sage Agent, users exhibit significantly higher levels of reflection on motivation, self-perceptions, and resilience &amp; coping, along with an enhanced experience of narrative transportation. Additionally, our qualitative findings suggest that Sage Agent plays a crucial role in promoting reflection on non-cognitive skills, enhancing social communication and decision-making performance, and improving overall user experience within Simulife++. Multiple supportive relationships between Sage Agent and users were also reported. We offer design implications for the application of generative AI in narrative solutions and the future potential of Sage Agent for non-cognitive skill development in broader social contexts. Our quantitative data and code are released at https://github.com/yzihan/Simulife.},

Work in two areas seems to offer strong candidates for a principled design and evaluative approach to creativity based on neural-cognitive analysis: (a) neuroscience in its mapping of creative acts to brain area and function, and (b) human performance assessing physical activity on cognition. In this paper we review the research in both these areas and propose example opportunities for design and evaluation informed by this research. We suggest as well both that the creativity and cognition community is ideally placed to extend neural "creativity cognition" research and that working from such a foundation may significantly reconfigure knowledge work software, hardware and work environment design.},

Analyzing 437 user reviews from 83 apps, we outline users’ predominant privacy and security concerns with currently available apps. We then compare those concerns to criteria from two prominent app evaluation websites – Privacy Not Included and One Mind PsyberGuide. Our findings show that MHA users have myriad data privacy and security concerns including a user’s control over their own data, but these concerns do not often overlap with those of experts from evaluation websites who focus more on issues such as required password strength. We highlight this disconnect and propose solutions in how the mental health care ecosystem can provide better guidance to MHA users and experts from the fields of privacy and security and mental health technology in choosing and evaluating, respectively, potentially useful mental health apps.},

Through a review of 38 research papers, this work maps trends, themes, and methods of empirical research on children and CAs in HCI research over the last decade. A thematic analysis of the research found that work in this domain focuses on seven key topics: ascribing human-like qualities to CAs, CAs? support of children?s learning, the use and role of CAs in the home and family context, CAs? support of children?s play, children?s storytelling with CA, issues concerning the collection of information revealed by CAs, and CAs designed for children with differing abilities. Based on our findings, we identify the needs to account for children’s intersectional identities and linguistic and cultural diversity and theories from multiple disciples in the design of CAs, develop heuristics for child-centric interaction with CAs, to investigate implications of CAs on social cognition and interpersonal relationships, and to examine and design for multi-party interactions with CAs for different domains and contexts.},

abstract = {What is here called controlled natural language CNL has traditionally been given many different names. Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.},

We don't do this simply to shed light but to influence change. We stand when others are forced to sit and speak when others are silenced. For many of us, the past several years have rendered our usual tools ineffective, and often we find ourselves seated, scared to stand, and essentially silenced as we search for new language to describe old problems. We increasingly, and rightfully, feel frustrate... powerles... angry. Unfortunately, we sometimes allow these feelings to lead us to inaction. However, as the Black feminist scholar Audre Lorde wrote in her masterpiece, Sister Outsider, anger, directed in productive ways, can be transformative.},

abstract = {Social robots are emerging as learning companions for children, and research shows that they facilitate the development of interest and learning even through brief interactions. However, little is known about how such technologies might support these goals in authentic environments over long-term periods of use and interaction. We designed a learning companion robot capable of supporting children reading popular-science books by expressing social and informational commentaries. We deployed the robot in homes of 14 families with children aged 10–12 for four weeks during the summer. Our analysis revealed critical factors that affected children’s long-term engagement and adoption of the robot, including external factors such as vacations, family visits, and extracurricular activities; family/parental involvement; and children’s individual interests. We present four in-depth cases that illustrate these factors and demonstrate their impact on children’s reading experiences and discuss the implications of our findings for robot design.},

abstract = {Experiential training, where mental health professionals practice their learned skills, remains the most costly component of therapeutic training. We introduce Pin-MI, a video-call-based tool that supports experiential learning of counseling skills used in motivational interviewing (MI)through interactive role-play as client and counselor. In Pin-MI, counselors annotate, or “pin” the important moments in their role-play sessions in real-time. The pins are then used post-session to facilitate a reflective learning process, in which both client and counselor can provide feedback about what went well or poorly during each pinned moment. We discuss the design of Pin-MI and a qualitative evaluation with a set of healthcare professionals learning MI. Our evaluation suggests that Pin-MI helped users develop empathy, be more aware of their skill usage, guaranteed immediate and targeted feedback, and helped users correct misconceptions about their performance. We discuss implications for the design of experiential training tools for learning counseling skills.},

abstract = {Social emotional skills are foundational competencies upon which children draw throughout their lives. This work investigates current, commercially available experiences for social emotional learning (SEL) through conversational agents (CAs). Specifically, we reviewed 3,767 Skills available in the "Kids" category of the Alexa Skills Marketplace and found 42 working Skills with connections to SEL. We found that the most common scenarios these Skills sought to support were: active listening, emotional wellbeing, conversation with other people, and politeness. The interaction patterns used by these Skills distilled into a taxonomy of styles we labeled: The Delegator, The Lecturer, The Bulldozer, and The One-Track Mind. We found that, collectively, these Skills provide shallow experiences and lack contingent feedback. To examine the gap between current offerings and families' needs, we also conducted 26 interviews with parents to probe parents' ideas about CAs supporting children's SEL. Parents see potential for CAs to support children in four concrete ways, including attuning to others, cultivating curiosity, reinforcing politeness, and developing emotional awareness. Despite their optimism about these opportunities, parents expressed skepticism about CAs' impoverished conversational abilities and worry about CAs advancing values and behavioral norms that are at odds with their own.},

abstract = {With the aim of better scaffolding discussion to improve learning in a MOOC context, this work investigates what kinds of discussion behaviors contribute to learning. We explored whether engaging in higher-order thinking behaviors results in more learning than paying general or focused attention to course materials. In order to evaluate whether to attribute the effect to engagement in the associated behaviors versus persistent characteristics of the students, we adopted two approaches. First, we used propensity score matching to pair students who exhibit a similar level of involvement in other course activities. Second, we explored individual variation in engagement in higher-order thinking behaviors across weeks. The results of both analyses support the attribution of the effect to the behavioral interpretation. A further analysis using LDA applied to course materials suggests that more social oriented topics triggered richer discussion than more biopsychology oriented topics.},

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},
